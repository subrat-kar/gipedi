GIPEDI -- The Global Internship Program in Engineering Design and Innovation
============================================================================

From July 15 2020, all batches of GIPEDI will only be conducted online (video conferencing) with one or more weekly interactions. Selected applicants must be able to video conference - with access to a PC/laptop with a reasonably good headphone + microphone, camera and good broadband Internet connection (20Mbps or more is desirable).

Applications for Internships are now open.

For the current status of your application please click on the Batch for which you have applied in the "Navigation" tab at the left of this page.

As the GIPEDI Program is being conducted online (due to Covid concerns), the weekly lectures and talks are free and can be attended by anybody - even if they have not registered as a participant in GIPEDI by submitting an application. 

The  weekly talk is held every Friday at  0800 hours during the Batch 2 only (summer vacation is on in IIT Delhi).

The GIPEDI is an Internship Program in the Electrical Sciences for students and professionally qualified engineers. It is a program of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, with logistic support from the Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer (FITT).

The Program runs throughout the year in four batches of different durations (Jan-May/May-July/July-Dec/Dec-Jan).

It welcomes applications from undergraduate and postgraduate students from recognized academic Institutions.

For professionally qualified Engineers, it offers Returnships for those who to get back to an active career after a break and Gap Internships for those professionals who wish to switch careers / are between two careers*.

Woman engineers and meritorious engineering students who need support or have special needs to fulfil professional aspirations are encouraged to apply under its affirmative action initiative.

The GIPEDI Internship is designed differently — it does not just train students to execute projects, it trains them in project planning, requirements analysis, specification generation, design iteration management, team work and ethics, behaviour management, team building, group etiquette and communication skills. Apart from a full set of technology modules, it also uses specially designed training modules in ethics, history through heritage sensitization / heritage walks and lessons from mythology to teach culturally-conscious and effective engineering practices.

* The Gap Internship is also appropriate for fresh graduates / post-graduates "on the bench" who are waiting to join a job or waiting to get admission to another program after completing one program or even for professionals who are in a switch between two careers. Gap Interns do not need a TPO signature (obviously) but they need to have two LoRs (for example, from a Senior Manager or a Senior Team Leader or a Faculty Member - someone who has seen you in action).
