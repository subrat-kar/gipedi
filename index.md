The GIPEDI is an Internship Program in the Electrical Sciences for students and professionally qualified engineers. It is a program of the <ins>[Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iitd.ac.in&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHxwmRLkLH7HEIk4ybn4b7Lq9_M2Q)</ins>, with logistic support from the Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer (<ins>[FITT](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitt-iitd.org&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF_p9I33LsFpNUxyZKG3nJ9wWgIew)</ins>).

The Program runs throughout the year in four batches of different durations (Jan-May/May-July/July-Dec/Dec-Jan).

It welcomes applications from undergraduate and postgraduate students from recognized academic Institutions.

For professionally qualified Engineers, it offers Returnships for those who to get back to an active career after a break and Gap Internships for those professionals who wish to switch careers / are between two careers*****.

Woman engineers and meritorious engineering students who need support or have special needs to fulfil professional aspirations are encouraged to apply under its affirmative action initiative.

The GIPEDI Internship is designed *differently* — it does not just train students to execute projects, it trains them in project planning, requirements analysis, specification generation, design iteration management, team work and ethics, behaviour management, team building, group etiquette and communication skills. Apart from a full set of technology modules, it also uses specially designed training modules in ethics, history through heritage sensitization / heritage walks and lessons from mythology to teach culturally-conscious and effective engineering practices.

***** *The Gap Internship is also appropriate for fresh graduates / post-graduates “on the bench” who are waiting to join a job or waiting to get admission to another program after completing one program or even for professionals who are in a switch between two careers. Gap Interns do not need a TPO signature (obviously) but they need to have two LoRs (for example, from a Senior Manager or a Senior Team Leader or a Faculty Member - someone who has seen you in action).*

Your TPO does not have to physically sign on the first page any longer - this No Objection / Forwarding can be done by the TPO sending an email.

Your TPO signature can be substituted by a email from your TPO to me. This email must be sent from the official institutional email (not from a gmail address or Yahoo address). Please ask your TPO to use the following format for the email sent.

**TPO’s Approval Email for <Name of Applicant> <Student ID> <Institute Name and Address>**

*Subject: No Objection Certificate for <Name of Applicant> <Student ID> <Institute Name and Postal Address>*

*To: Prof Subrat Kar, Coordinator GIPEDI Program*

*Dear Sir,*

*As TPO, I certify that <Applicant> <Student ID> <Year and Discipline> of our Institute <Name of Institute and Postal Address> is hereby allowed to apply for the GIPEDI Internship Program in IIT Delhi.*

*I also certify that he/she will be able to attend this Program if selected and that there is no exam / academic evaluation etc which will interfere with his/her participation.*

*(The TPO should certify the statement in this paragraph only for applicants seeking financial waiver) As he/she is in need of financially assistance (total annual income of both parents together being less than Rs 1 lakh as per financial proof attached), I also endorse the request for waiver of fees made by the applicant.*

*<Name of the TPO>*

*Official email (gmail / Yahoo / rediffmail etc will not do)*
